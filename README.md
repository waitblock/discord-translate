# Discord Translate

## Configuration
1. Create a file called 'channels.txt', and a file called 'TOKEN'
2. Add any channels you want the bot to translate in to the 'channels.txt' file (one channel ID per line)
3. Add your bot's token in the 'TOKEN' file
4. Go to line 6 in 'main.py', and modify the below configuration variables with the correct information
5. The bot should now run and translate to the configured language in the channels specified

If the bot does not seem to be working properly, please send me an issue in the 'Issues' tab of this repository.
